    <h2><u>About Dehradun:</u></h2>
    <p>Dehradun is located in the Doon Valley on the foothills of the Himalayas nestled between Song river, a tributary
        of Ganga on the east and the Asan river, a tributary of Yamuna on the west. The city is noted for its
        picturesque landscape and slightly milder climate and provides a gateway to the surrounding region.

        conducted by Dainik Jagran and KPMG, Dehradun is one of India's safest cities.[16][17] Dehradun is also known
        for its Basmati rice and bakery products.
        Also known as the 'Abode of Drona', Dehradun has been an important center for Garhwal rulers and was captured by

    <h2><u>History of Dehradun</u></h2>
    <p><u><b><i>About Us</i></b></u><br><br>The history of the city of Uttarakhand, Dehradun (nicknamed "Doon Valley")
        is linked to the story of Ramayana and Mahabharata. It is believed that after the battle between Ravana and Lord
        Rama, Lord Rama and his brother Lakshmana visited this site. Also, known as 'Dronanagari' on the name of
        Dronacharya, legendary Royal guru to the Kauravas and Pandavas in the epic Mahabharata, is believed to have been
        born and resided in Dehradun.[29] Evidences such as ancient temples and idols have been found in the areas
        surrounding Dehradun which have been linked to the mythology of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These relics and ruins
        are believed to be around 2000 years old. Furthermore, the location, the local traditions and the literature
        reflect this region's links with the events of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Even after the battle of Mahabharata,
        the Pandavas had an influence on this region as the rulers of Hastinapura with the descendants of Subahu ruled
        the region as subsidiaries. Likewise, Rishikesh is mentioned in the pages of history when Lord Vishnu answered
        the prayers of the saints, slaughtered the demons and handed the land to the saints. The adjoining place called
        Chakrata has its historical impression during the time of Mahabharata.</p>
